Android Specific Architecture 

//todo
auto status update and calculation over status e.g.
    1) cellular network strenght and other status regarding call and data activity,
    2) user battery status whenever it is critically low and other updates, 
    3) user calling history,
    4) sync with user callender to make phone profile depending on the event,
    5) user task list if any ?,
    6) custom status monitoring and result generation - kind of AI,

1) cellular network informaton - telephony manager
