2 ) Battery 
    1.Determine the Current Charging State,
        int status,
        boolean isCharging,
        int chargePlug,
        boolean usbCharge,
        boolean acCharge 

    2.Monitor Changes in Charging State,
        need to implement brodcast reciver for the step one

    3.Determine the Current Battery Level,
        int level,
        int scale,
        float batteryPct,
    
    4.Monitor Significant Changes in Battery Level,
        implement battery level reciver
